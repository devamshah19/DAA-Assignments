Given the array 
3,9,2,5,11,4,100,20
we want to find the 6
6-rd order statistic (which is the 7
7-th smallest element):

The array is partitioned around a chosen pivot. Let's say after partitioning, the array becomes 
2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 11, 20, 100
11 at index 6
Since i(6) matches the pivot index, we have found our element, which is 11
